//for this task what i can do is:
/*
 * make 10 tabs in horizontal layout
 * and each tab will contain 10 headlines stored in vertical layout
 * 
 * so 10*10 = 100 headlines we will have for now
 * 
 * if let say we put another url and we have 17 headlines now
 * 
 * then what we will do is:
 * set active only two tabs in horizontal layout (only first two)
 * 
 * and then in first one we will have 10 headlines set to setactive
 * then in seconds tab we will have only first seven headlines as set active and remain three inactive
 * 
 * in this way we can show the number of headlines we got and remaining places will be set active false.
