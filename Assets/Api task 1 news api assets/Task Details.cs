//Tasks://• Create a news App that would fetch data from the API: https://newsapi.org/
//and display them along with images. The first screen will contain the list of news with headlines and thumbnails and when an item is clicked,
//it will open the 2nd screen that will contain the full image, headline, and article text. Something like inshorts.//• There will be 2 parts, Registration and View. In registration, there will be//    a generic registration form with basic details(5 fields, at least). A user//    will register and the data will be stored in a JSON file//    created on https://jsonbin.io/.
//                     //
////In view, the user will be able to view a few details of all the users from the JSON file that was created.
